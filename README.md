# Uriel Test Plugin
An example plugin to use as a reference to create Uriel plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> It's recommended to use Kotlin as the JVM language for your plugin, as it allows for seamless development. Uriel is not 100% compatible with other JVM languages.

All Uriel components are available from within plugins, except for internal functions and constructors.
